# Robot Motion Planning

Builds STL files for 3D objects representing the different levels of Minkowski Sums when a "robot" moves from one end to another end of a 2D path with obstacles.

To run project

```
git clone https://github.com/YeabkalA/RobotMotionPlanning.git
cd RobotMotionPlanning
cd src
javac *.java
java Environment

```

Example of entering polygon information:
For polygon with coordinates (0,0), (1,0) and (1,1), input would be:

```
0 0 1 0 1 1
```

Generated STL files will be saved in the STLs directory.

Enjoy!
